                alt="An infographic explaining Call Numbers. The first part of the call number appears before the decimal point and is treated as a whole number, representing a general topic area. Find this number on the library shelf first.

The second part of the call number appears after the decimal point and represents the subtopic. Each digit in this number is read separately. Find the first number, then move onto the second number, and so on.

A space appears next to separate the next number.

The next number (called the Shelf list) tells you where the item is shelved. In this example, within the number 523.105. , this book is the 12th item in this section.

If you see a letter after the shelf list number, this tells you the edition of the item and is sorted alphabetically. So, “A” comes first." />
